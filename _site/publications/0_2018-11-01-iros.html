<p>Generalized Multiple Correlation Coefficient (GMCC) is presented like the natural extension of the Multiple Correlation Coefficient. The motivation of this paper is two-fold: First, to introduce a new correlation metric that presents the best properties to compute similarities between trajectories invariant to linear transformations and compare it with some state of the art similarity distances. Second, to present a natural way of integrating the similarity metric in an Imitation Learning scenario for clustering robot trajectories.</p>
