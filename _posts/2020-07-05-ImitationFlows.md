Dynamic Systems represent the time evolution of a point in a  geometrical space. Dynamic Systems can model apple's motion falling from a tree, the heat diffusion in a room or a robot's motion playing table tennis.

An Important property of Dynamic Systems is the Stability. The Stability Theory studies how a the motion in a dynamic system changes under some perturbation. Given a point running
