Dynamic Systems represent the time evolution of a point in a  geometrical space. Dynamic Systems can model apple's motion falling from a tree, the heat diffusion in a room or a robot's motion playing table tennis.

An Important property of Dynamic Systems is the Stability. The Stability Theory studies how the motion in a dynamic system changes under some perturbation. Given a point running

In this article we will introduce how we can build stable stochastic nonlinear dynamics by the combination of Linear Dynamics and Normalizing Flows. For more information you can go to our paper  ¨¨add citation¨¨


## Linear Stochastic Dynamics & Stability

Linear Dynamic Systems consider a linear function between the state and the time derivative of the state

\begin{equation}
\dot{x} = A x
\end{equation}

Linear Dynamics has been further studied. Thanks to their simplicity, there has been plenty of mathematical research on them.
