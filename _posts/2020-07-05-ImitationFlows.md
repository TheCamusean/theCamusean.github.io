<h1 class="size-50">Introduction to ImitationFlows</h1>

**Dynamic Systems** represent the time evolution of a point in a geometrical space. Dynamic Systems can model apple's motion falling from a tree, the heat diffusion in a room or a robot's motion playing table tennis.

An Important property of Dynamic Systems is the **Stability**. The Stability Theory studies how the trajectories generated by a dynamic system diverges under perturbations. Given a globally stable dynamic system, a set of trajectories with different initial states will evolve towards the same target.

Stability guarantee is of particular interest in Robotics. If we think in most of the motions the robots perform, they could be thought as trajectories sampled from a stable dynamic system. Tasks like peg-in-a-hole, pouring or opening a door can be modeled as stable nonlinear dynamic systems w.r.t. a certain target pose. Other type of robot policies, like walking or juggling policies, can be modeled as stable limit cycles. If we are able to ensure that our robot policies are stable, we can avoid undesirable situations such as robots going out of their joint limits or unmeaningful stability regions. Moreover, in policy learning scenarios, imposing stability in our policies could help us to reduce the family of possible solutions to a set of stable policies and could help us to have a safer exploration.

Therefore, wondering which policy architectures could help us in the learning of stable nonlinear dynamic systems was an important question in my research line and I decided to follow this path to find the architecture I am presenting in my first blog post.

In the following, I will try to show how combining the invertible neural networks of the **Normalizing Flows** and linear stable dynamics we can represent highly nonlinear stable dynamics that could be applied as robot policies.


## Linear Dynamics & Stability

Linear Dynamic Systems consider a linear function between the state and the time derivative of the state

\begin{align}
  \dot{x} = A x
  \label{eq:linear}
\end{align}

Given their simplicity, the stability of this type of dynamics can be easily studied. As long as the real part of the eigenvalues of the A matrix is negative, $\mathbf{R}_e (\lambda_A) <0$; then, the dynamics are going to be globally asymptotically stable.

Stability can be intuitively understand if we represent the dynamics as the gradient descent on a energy function $V(\cdot)$

$$\dot{x} = - \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x}.$$

When the energy function is quadratic, $V(x) = x A x^{\intercal}$, we recover the linear dynamics in Eq. \ref{eq:linear}. Given the energy-based dynamics representation, stability will be guaranteed as long as $V(x)$ is a convex function.
