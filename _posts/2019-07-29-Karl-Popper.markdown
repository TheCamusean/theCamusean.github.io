# Chapter 1: The historicism

Historicism is about predicting the future of the history observing the past. From a mathematical perspective, Historicism is about modeling a dynamical system that would represent the history.

\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} = f(x,t)
\end{equation}


In The Foundation, Isaac Asimov brought the same concept, in a fictional way, through the Psycohistory.


# Chapter 2: Heraclitus

Heraclitus can be observed as the father of the dynamical systems. Before Heraclitus, everything was steady. Heraclitus brought the idea of the movement, if I enter in the river two times, I am not entering in the two different rivers. The world is in constant transformation.

However, there are some laws that describe this world transformation and these laws are steady, they dont change through the time.

We can observe the laws in two ways. On one side, we have the nature laws. On the other side, the state laws. It is very interesting the relationship of the tribal communes with the laws. For tribal states, there was no difference between nature laws and state laws and they were not able to think in breaking a state law in the same way we cannot think in the sun breaking his orbit law.
